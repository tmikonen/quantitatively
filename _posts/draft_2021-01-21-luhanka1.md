# Luhanka

In late November, I joined a small group of friends for a weekend of Old School Magic: the Gathering. Tero, one of the Old School aficionados at Jyv채skyl채, had rented a cabin near the small village of Luhanka, where we would spend the weekend playing and trading cards. I took the Friday off work to pack, prepare, and drive there from south of Finland - it was going to be a three-hour drive to the cabin and we had a small tournament planned already for the Friday evening. At around 4 pm, I jumped into my VW and started the drive north[^1]. By the time I got to Luhanka, it was already completely dark and I managed to miss the cabin by about half a kilometer before I noticed that the GPS was instructing me to turn back. I backed up, exited the small country road to an even smaller gravel road that lead up a small hill to the cabin. I was glad that there was no snow on the ground. The ascent up the narrow and relatively steep path might have been a bit too exciting otherwise.

I parked the car next to the cabin, a safe distance away from the edge of the hill. It seemed I was the first to arrive, so I called Tero for instructions on getting inside. In short order, I got the key from its security box and went inside. The cabin was spacious, bedrooms and a common area downstairs and more sleeping space upstairs. And, of course, a sauna with a wood stove on the first floor. Excellent!

I didn't have to wait for long for the rest of the guys. The first to arrive was Tuukka, coming from Turku at the western coast of Finland, and the Jyv채skyl채 crew of Tero, Jarno and Ilkka came shortly after. We settled in, made sure there was wood for the sauna and unpacked the cards. The first event of the weekend would be a mini-tournament of 97/98 Type II (or, at least, something resembling that).

# Mirage-Tempest tournament

I had prepared two separate decks for the format. Namely, the Pros-Bloom combo deck, and a mono blue Tradewind deck. Both are [well known archetypes](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/flashback-standard-gauntlets-mirage-tempest) from Mirage-Tempest standard. I never actually played during that time period (I had quit well before Weatherlight came out) so I was interested to try out these decks. I had goldfished a the Pros-Bloom a little bit a few weeks before so I was relatively familiar with how it worked. Full-on, non-interactive, combo is not really my thing, though, so eventually I opted for the mono blue alternative. That deck can effectively play a counter-heavy tempo / control game, which is basically my comfort zone in Magic. Even though I had not played a single game with the deck, I felt pretty confident piloting it.

*The mono blue Tradewind / Forbidian deck. Quite a stock lineup, except for the 12 card sideboard (I didn't have enough period-authentic blue cards for a complete side board). In retrospect, adding 3 Islands to the sideboard would have been a reasonable solution to side out the Quicksands.*

We had just 5 players for this event, so we simply decided to pair everybody against everybody and see who would get the most points. So, four matches for everybody.
