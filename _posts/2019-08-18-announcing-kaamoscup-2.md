## Main Event

The main event is a 93/94 old school tournament, following the [Swedish banned and restricted list](http://oldschool-mtg.blogspot.com/p/banrestriction.html), with the gentlemen's addendum (Library of Alexandria and Mind Twist are **banned**). We also allow reprints and proxies as detailed below.

All the Magic: the Gathering cards printed in the sets between Limited Edition Alpha and The Dark are legal. This includes the sets:
- Alpha

### Reprint and proxy policy

All non-foil reprints with original art are considered legal. This includes cards from the Collectors' Edition, International Collectors' Edition, the Pro Tour 1996 decks, and non-english reprints such as the Italian Legends. The alternate art version of Plateau and Serendib Efreet from the Revised edition are also considered legal.

In addition, a maximum of **ten proxy cards** are allowed in the deck (including both the main deck and the sideboard). The proxy cards should adhere to the same visual guidelines as the rest of the deck (original art) and, upon examination, *they need to be easily distinguishable as proxy cards.* For example, an image of the proxied card printed on paper in color within the same sleeve as an actual Magic card is OK.

### Rules and Errata

The tournament is played with modern Magic: the Gathering rules. This includes the London Mulligan rule, effective since July 12, 2019. Each card is played according to their current Oracle wording, with the exception of Chaos Orb and Falling Star, which have the [following errata](http://oldschool-mtg.blogspot.com/p/banrestriction.html):

Chaos Orb (2)<br>
Artifact<br>
*1, Tap: Choose a nontoken permanent on the battlefield. If Chaos Orb is on the battlefield, flip Chaos Orb onto the battlefield from a height of at least one foot. If Chaos Orb turns over completely at least once during the flip, and touches the chosen permanent, destroy that permanent. Then destroy Chaos Orb.*

Falling Star (2R)<br>
Sorcery<br>
*Choose any number of non-overlapping creatures on the battlefield. Flip Falling Star from a height of at least one foot. If Falling Star turns over completely at least 360 degrees during the flip, it deals 3 damage to each chosen creature it lands on. Any creatures damaged by Falling Star that are not destroyed become tapped.*

**Note:** For both dexterity cards, you are allowed a "fair flip"; i.e. you may move the card(s) you're choosing to a different position on the playing area to get a good flip.

### Prizes

The prizes consist of the cards given to the prize pool by the participants. At the end of the main event, each participant chooses one card to keep. The pick order is:
1. The most creative deck
2. The best unpowered deck
3. The rest of the players, in the order of standings

## ABU-40 after afterparty

If enough participants with [Alpha](../wizards_tournament_2) decks (as in the [Wizards' Tournament](http://www.n00bcon.com/wizardstournament.txt)) show up, casual Alpha games will be played after the main event. So bring your Alpha deck with you. Or if you like sharper corners or whiter borders, bring your ABU-40 deck. Same constructions rules as for Alpha, except cards from the Limited Edition Beta and the Unlimited Edition (including Circle of Protection: Black and Volcanic Island) are also legal. **No reprints or proxies are allowed.**
