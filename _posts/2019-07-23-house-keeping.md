## House Keeping

This time, it's a very short post. Instead of writing on the fun stuff I've been working on for this blog, or the awesome [Ivory Cup 4](http://www.wak-wak.se/ic4) I went a couple of weeks ago, I find myself forced to spend time on technical blog maintenance. Why? Simply, because the [third party service provider](http://www.just-comments.com) that I have been using to host the blog comments has decided to change their business model. While I have really liked their service for the most part, my reasons for using it have been 1) it's add-free and, 2) it's free (apart from the initial investment of about 5 euros). Starting from August, the service would cost me about 60 euros per year, which in my opinion is too much for this kind of a low-traffic, niche of a niche blog.

I'm currently trying out different options to see which might work best with reasonable maintenance load. Until I get the system fully up and running (which I hope will be soon), there may be some weird comments on the site as I am testing it. I'll clean them up and import the ones from the old system eventually.

But for the moment, commenting is basically offline. You can reach me via email and other channels, though.
