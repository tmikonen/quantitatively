### Reprint and proxy policy

All non-foil reprints with the original art are considered legal. This includes cards from the Collectors' Edition, International Collectors' Edition, and the Pro Tour 1996 decks.

In addition, a maximum of **five proxy cards** are allowed in the deck (including both the main deck and the sideboard). The proxy cards should adhere to the same visual guidelines as the rest of the deck (original art) and, *they need to be easily distinguishable as proxy cards.* For example, an image of the proxied card printed on paper in color within the same sleeve as an actual Magic card are OK.

### Rules and Errata

The tournament is played with modern Magic: the Gathering. This includes the London Mulligan rule, effective since July 12, 2019. Each card is played according to their current Oracle wording, with the exception of Chaos Orb and Falling Star, which have the following errata:

Chaos Orb (2)<br>
Artifact<br>
*1, Tap: Choose a nontoken permanent on the battlefield. If Chaos Orb is on the battlefield, flip Chaos Orb onto the battlefield from a height of at least one foot. If Chaos Orb turns over completely at least once during the flip, and touches the chosen permanent, destroy that permanent. Then destroy Chaos Orb.*

Falling Star (2R)<br>
Sorcery<br>
*Choose any number of non-overlapping creatures on the battlefield. Flip Falling Star from a height of at least one foot. If Falling Star turns over completely at least 360 degrees during the flip, it deals 3 damage to each chosen creature it lands on. Any creatures damaged by Falling Star that are not destroyed become tapped.*

# Alpha afterparty

If enough participants with [Alpha](../wizards_tournament_2) decks (as in the [Wizards' Tournament](http://www.n00bcon.com/wizardstournament.txt)) show up, casual Alpha games will be played after the main event. So bring your Alpha cards with you.
