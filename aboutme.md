subtitle: Who am I and why do I write this blog

Hi! My name is Timo Ikonen. I am a physicist and algorithm developer living in the capital area of Finland. I'm also passionate about board games, card games, their history and, old-school Magic: the Gathering (MTG) in particular.

What's this blog about? Well, lately I've been thinking a lot about old-school (early to mid-90's) period MTG and how to frame some of the questions in that game as mathematical problems. This has lead me to work on a number calculations and numerical simulations that least I find quite interesting and even entertaining. This blog is a place for me to organize and share them. So if mathematics and card games is your thing, I hope you enjoy!
