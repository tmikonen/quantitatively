subtitle: Who am I and why do I write this blog

Hi! My name is Timo Ikonen. I am a physicist and algorithm developer living in the capital area of Finland. I'm also passionate about board games, card games, their history and, old-school Magic: the Gathering in particular.

So why this blog? Well, in general I tend to think about the mathematical side of things quite a lot. Lately I've been interested in MTG, and its old-school (early to mid-90's) period, and this interest seems to produce quite a lot of interesting mathematical questions and simulation problems that I've been working on. This blog is a place for me to organize and share them with other enthusiasts. So if mathematics and card games is your thing, enjoy!
