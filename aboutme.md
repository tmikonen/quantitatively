subtitle: Who am I and why do I write this blog

Hi! I am a physicist and an algorithm developer living in the capital area of Finland. I'm also passionate about board games, card games, their history and, old-school Magic: the Gathering in particular.

Lately I've been thinking a lot about old-school (early to mid-90's) Magic and how to formulate some of the questions arising in that game as mathematical problems. This has lead me to work on a number of calculations and numerical simulations that at least I find quite interesting and sometimes even entertaining. This blog is a place for me to write about and share them. So, if mathematics and card games is your thing: enjoy!

-Timo
