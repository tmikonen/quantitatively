message: "Thanks for you comment! I am not sure where my preferences lie. We currently play with Swedish + reprints at our playgroup, but experiencing the four Strip Mines in action was certainly refreshing. But I was definitely surprised at how much is affects the availability of coloured mana. It was also pointed out to me that the importance of having 2 coloured sources on turn 2 is why some White Weenie players prefer to not run any Mishra's Factories in the US."
