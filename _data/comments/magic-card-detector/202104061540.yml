message: "I tried using the detector but it made a couple errors for me, so i had to change a few things. thanks for making this! 1: cv2.findContours returns 2, not 3 values, so i had to delete some of the _'s. maybe i'm using a later version of cv2? 2: in savehash.py, mcg.MagicCardDetector() yields an error since there's no output path being given."
