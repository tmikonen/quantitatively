message: "Thanks to all for the nice comments, and good suggestions. I have not been active in my hobby projects since almost a year now. Because of the 'new normal' all of us are living in, I have had a lot less spare time than before. I'll try to give some attention to the Magic card detector, but unfortunately I can't commit to any schedule. I also have some other things lined up from last year waiting to be written down and published."
