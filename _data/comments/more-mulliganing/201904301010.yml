message: "Thank you! I agree that the most interesting change would be the players' behavior. In old school the relative change in the power levels of different archetypes may not be that significant, compared to something like vintage, for example. Kevin Cron and Stephen Menendian recently discussed the implications of the mulligan change to vintage in their So Many Insane Plays podcast (episode 88). It's an excellent discussion. I highly recommend listening to it if you find vintage at all interesting."
