message: "Love this blog. Just want to emphasis, as you note in the previous post; that the most significant change (if any) would be in player behavior. E.g. while a two card combo goes from 21 to 31pct, which is a very large increase, sideboard (1 of 4) goes from 73 to 78% - so anybody looking for e.g. a Disenchant or a REB will now find it in close to 4/5 games. This could affect behavior quite a lot, going for more combo in game 1, and more seriously considering transformational sideboards in game 2 as the combo player."
