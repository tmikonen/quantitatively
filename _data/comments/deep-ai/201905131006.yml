message: "Hi! Was planning to comment the Wizard II tournament report but the sheer quality of the other comments scared me of. Now I dont know Mg (or the other well spoken fella) but I´m guessing that post was rigth up his alley! Great writeup btw! loved it! I´ve just recently stumbled up on you blog and i looks sweet, very frankkarstenish! I have a question and perhaps a quest for you; can you help me calculate the 'right' number of onecasting cost oldshool goblins necessary to reliably cast goblin grenades? the deck is mainly red with 14 red souces and 4 grenades. Svante said 11 was enough. is this calculable? Sincerely Jonas"
