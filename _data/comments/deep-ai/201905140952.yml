message: "Yeah, your report was awesome! Well, as you say there is a lot of different ways to look at it, but i think the simplier version of just calculating the probability of casting a grenade turn 2 is most viable. well, the deck idéa emerged when i tested the Sylvan-tower-tax-leng-edge deck that one of the americans played to great success some time ago (I think alltingsconsidered discussed it at length at some time). i don´t own any power besides CE ancestral so i skipped blue and added 4 winds of change. when you cast a winds with 12+ cards in hand it feels kinda nice. This lead to a deck that plays only 1cc cards so that you can winds lands away for more cards. So i filled the deck with Land Tax, Savannah Lions, Kird Apes, 8 bolts, Giant growths, 4 winds of change,1 balance and 4 scryb sprites (i planned to play Ghazban ogres first but somehow i dont own any, not even chronicles abominations, but in retrospect, playing an ogre of a City of brass seem bad somehow :) ). As spice I added 4 Mana Clash which worked above expectations. Lands included 4 City, 4 rainbow vale, and 12 basics (don´t own any duals). I tweaked it a bit (added Atogs and ankhs and felt the deck had evovled out of scope). I removed green (and the apes) and added blue for Flying men and Mind Bomb. Added Vise. Mind Bomb and vise is not good, but ditching lands to bomb seem nice. But it dont work particually good. This iteration only had 8 creatures. So i´m going back to a WR only build with goblins. the deck looks like 4 Savannah Lions 4 Land Tax (3 might be enough) 4 Winds of Change 8 Bolts 2-4 Mana Clash (prob 2) 4 Goblin Grenades 1 Balance 20 lands (drops rainbow and add some FE sac lands) 0-4 Black Vise rest goblins. The idea is to play very few lands, somethimes 1-2 lands out, sandbag the rest and winds it away. First deck had 2 Winter Orbs but i never got it to work . The WUR version runs i balance and one wheel outside the onedrops. It would be really sweet if you can tweak this deck statistically. I know that it´s far from a Tier1 deck but the games go kinda quick. And as long as you dont run into Ivory Tower (or cop red) you can win som games of three quick bolts, /Jonas"
