message: "The Plague Rat deck is indeed very interesting. The challenge here is that the optimal deck probably depends on what kind of deck we are facing. Assuming a non-reactive opponent and optimising the damage output so as to reach 20 or more damage as fast as possible can be done. But my worry is that the assuming the opponent cannot slow this down may not be a good enough. Do you have any suggestions on this point?"
