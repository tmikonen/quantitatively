message: "Hi Michael. Thank you for the comment - if you do make similar calculations, please do share them in some way. I would be interested in learning what other people find out. And you are absolutely correct: in the first version of the calculations I did more than a year ago, I did not correctly initialize the deck. The result was essentially a smoothening out of the peak in the win percentage curve. So, congratulations! We finally have a winner to the puzzle. :)"
